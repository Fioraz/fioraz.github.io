<h1>Unveiling Air Visio: A Ground-breaking Exploration in Air Quality Monitoring</h1>
<p>Welcome to the hub of innovation where technology meets environmental consciousness! In a pioneering endeavor, I spearheaded the development of an IoT marvel—Air Visio—an advanced air quality monitoring and analysis system. This transformative project seamlessly integrates hardware and software components, showcasing my proficiency in programming, IoT networking, data collection, visualization, analytics, big data handling, machine learning, reporting, and research skills.</p>


<p>The heart of Air Visio lies in an intricately engineered IoT device powered by Arduino and programmed with C/C++. This device serves as the vigilant sentinel, capturing real-time air quality data in a specific area. The synergy between hardware and software is further highlighted by an Android mobile app that I meticulously crafted. This app not only provides users with immediate access to local air quality information but goes beyond by predicting nationwide air quality trends.</p>


<p>One of the standout features of Air Visio is its intelligent predictive system embedded within the mobile app. Leveraging heatmaps and Google Map APIs, the app not only forecasts air quality but ingeniously determines the least polluted travel route. This innovative functionality not only empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their daily commutes but also contributes to a collective effort in minimizing exposure to air pollutants.</p>


<p>The impact of this research extends beyond the development of a cutting-edge system. Air Visio has been recognized and celebrated on prestigious platforms, with research findings presented at two conferences: IEEE and ICAC. This acknowledgment underscores the significance of the project in the realm of environmental technology and showcases the depth of my expertise in this multifaceted field.</p>


<p>In essence, Air Visio is not just a device; it's a testament to the fusion of technology and environmental stewardship. Through this project, I have not only demonstrated technical prowess but have also contributed to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable living. Stay tuned for more ground-breaking innovations as we continue to explore the intersection of technology and positive environmental impact.</p>

<h2>MSc Dissertation: Forensic Analysis of Credit Scoring Mobile Applications</h2>
<p>Credit scoring applications are very popular in the United Kingdom as they provide instant access to information related to credit scores and credit reports. Users can use these applications to check their credit assessment, and entitlement for credit cards and loans, monitor the movement of their credit score, etc.</p>


<p>Although credit scoring applications collect user-sensitive data, there is a lack of research to address credit scoring applications’ privacy and security concerns on popular mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. Hence, the frequency of potential security and privacy breaches and their impacts are unknown. This study aims to identify the data remnants which are left by credit scoring applications as they can be a significant contributor to prospective security and privacy breaches.</p>


<p>A comprehensive forensic analysis of three popular credit scoring applications: ClearScore, Credit Karma, and Experian was performed on both Android and iOS mobile platforms to identify the security and privacy concerns of the applications. Logical data images were acquired from the local storage, for two case scenarios: before and after uninstalling the applications. The user’s personal information including name, address, phone number, email address, etc was recovered from the images.</p>


<p>Thus, this study concludes that despite these applications incorporating various security features, it was possible to recover the user-sensitive data from the data remnants which were left behind. From the perspective of digital forensics, this study provides a rich source of forensic information related to credit scoring applications.</p>
