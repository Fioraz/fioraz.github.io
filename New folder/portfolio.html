<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>


<h2>1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Projects</h2>
<p>Throughout my extensive career as a full-stack developer, I've been deeply involved in the conception, design, and implementation of advanced AI-driven projects. I leverage a robust combination of Python programming, RESTful APIs, sophisticated Machine Learning models, and cutting-edge cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.</p>


<p>Among my most notable achievements is the creation of a Document Verification System, an all-encompassing solution meticulously crafted to streamline, enhance, and automate the document verification process. This ambitious project involved the end-to-end development of APIs and web-based applications, seamlessly integrating advanced Machine Learning models for real-time, highly accurate, and efficient document analysis and verification.</p>


<p>Leveraging Azure's state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure played a pivotal role in ensuring the system's exceptional scalability, robust security measures, and unparalleled reliability. Additionally, I successfully developed and deployed an AI-powered conversational agent using Python, OpenAI's LLMs, and Rasa, significantly boosting user engagement and transforming online interactions.</p>

<h2>2. Software Development Projects</h2>
<p>Leveraging a strong foundation in software engineering, honed through my Masters, Bachelors degree, the Hyperiondev Bootcamp, and a Python Bootcamp on Udemy, I've delved deep into UI/UX design, Python programming, debugging, and software development. This hands-on experience culminated in the creation of a diverse array of object-oriented projects. The portfolio boasts over 30 applications, ranging from engaging game applications to practical SMS and email alert/notification apps.</p>

<h2>3. Cyber Security Projects</h2>
<p>During my pursuit of a Master's degree in cyber security, I conducted a forensic analysis of credit scoring mobile applications on Android and iOS platforms. This in-depth examination aimed to uncover data remnants, revealing potential security vulnerabilities. In another project, I developed a robust Information Security Management System (ISMS) by crafting a security policy and management plan based on ISO27001.</p>
