# Recreated Portfolio Site

This is an original, responsive static site inspired by the structure of the requested site. It intentionally uses original wording and images from Unsplash (hotlinked) as placeholders.

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repo named `yourusername.github.io` (or any name for a project site).
2. Upload the files preserving the folder structure.
3. If using a project repo, enable GitHub Pages (Settings â†’ Pages) and select the main branch and `/` root.

Customize the copy and replace placeholder images in `/assets` with your own files.
